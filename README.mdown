Slippy - HTML Slides
====================

Demo
----

See the example slide deck live on [slides.seld.be](http://slides.seld.be/?file=2010-05-30+Example.html)

How to: Navigate slide decks
----------------------------

Navigate, double click anywhere, press space or use the left/up and right/down arrow keys

Go to a slide directly, press number keys and then enter

Get an overview, press escape or delete then click on a slide to go straight to it

How to: Make your own slide deck
--------------------------------

At the core, slide decks are simple HTML files. Every slide can be any html element,
but is typically a div or section. You initialize slippy by calling `slippy()` on a
jQuery selection, for example, if you add the `slide` class to all your slide divs,
use: `$(".slide").slippy({})`. Using the `slide` class is recommended because that's
what the default CSS file is using, but you're free to do what you want.

To get quickly started, you can use the `2010-05-30 Example.html` file which is an
example slide deck, and edit it, however if you prefer to do it all by hand, here are
the parts you need to add to your HTML file:

    <!-- jQuery + history plugin -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.history.js"></script>

    <!-- Slippy core js file -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="slippy.js"></script>

    <!-- Slippy structural styles -->
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="slippy.css"/>

    <!-- Slippy theme (feel free to change it) -->
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="slippy-pure.css"/>

In addition, if you want syntax highlighting, you should add the following files.
Using it is simple, just create a `<pre>` tag with a `class="brush: js"` to highlight
javascript code for example. You can read more on the
[SyntaxHighlighter](http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/) website itself.

    <!-- Syntax highlighting core file  -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="highlighter/shCore.js"></script>

    <!-- Syntax highlighting brushes, this one is only for javascript -->
    <script type="text/javascript" src="highlighter/shBrushJScript.js"></script>

    <!-- Syntax highlighting core CSS and a theme -->
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="highlighter/shCore.css"/>
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="highlighter/shThemeEclipse.css"/>

Finally you should initialize Slippy and the syntax highlighter:

    <script type="text/javascript">
        $(function() {
            $(".slide").slippy({});
            SyntaxHighlighter.all();
        });
    </script>

Images are automatically scaled to fit onto the slide whatever the size of the
browser window. You can tweak the behaviour with the baseWidth and imgScaleTrivial
parameters (see below). If one of your images should never be scaled, add the class
"noscale" to the <img> tag, i.e. <img src="text.png" class="noscale"/>

The slippy() call takes an option object, which accepts the following keys:

- animLen, duration for default animations (0 = disabled)
- animInForward, receives a slide and animates it
- animInRewind, receives a slide and animates it
- animOutForward, receives a slide and animates it
- animOutRewind, receives a slide and animates it
- baseWidth, defines the base for img resizing, if you don't want only
  full-width images, specify this as the pixel width of a slide so that
  images are scaled properly (default is 620px wide). Set to false to not scale images.
- imgScaleTrivial, defines the limit beneath that images are not scaled to avoid
  unnecessary scaling that renders the image less nice.
- ratio, defines the width/height ratio of the slides, defaults to 1.3 (620x476)
- margin, the fraction of screen to use as slide margin, defaults to 0.15

How to: Show images fullscreen
------------------------------

If a slide contains a `data-background` attribute, the referenced image will be
inserted fullscreen, and the background (if the image is not of the same aspect ratio
as the screen) will turn black. Example:

```html
<div class="slide" data-background="foo.jpg">
    <h1>Content</h1>
</div>
```

Server
------

The `src/` folder contains an index.php that serves slides.

- Put the `src` folder inside the webroot of a web server
- Copy `config.php.dist` to `config.php` and adjust to point to the folder containing
  your slides - or just copy/symlink all slides into the `src` folder. The
  `index.php` looks for html files in that folder and shows them, using the
  header information for title and author.

Exporting self-contained HTML presentations
-------------------------------------------

Slippy can generate a presentation in a single file, with all javascript, css
and images inlined.

    php src/index.php <slippy slides> [<output file>]

If you omit the output file, slippy will generate the filename from the input
file, appending _compiled to the name.

If you set up the slippy webserver (see above), you can also click the download link.

Limitation: If you use images in css statements, they are not included. If you
need to do that, you should generate a PDF instead (see below).

Exporting PDFs
--------------

To upload your presentation on SlideShare, or to share it with others, it can be convenient to
export it to a PDF. Slippy comes with a CLI utility that does just that.

The only requirement is that you download [PhantomJS](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/downloads/list) (2.0+)
and [pdftk](http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) and place the executables in the `bin/phantomjs`
and `bin/pdftk` dirs or make them accessible via your `PATH` environment variable. If you're on linux you can
probably install pdftk with your distro's package manager.

Once that is done, you can call the script using `bin/slippy-pdf.sh <path to your html presentation> <path to the pdf file to generate>`.

It will take a while and then should output a 4:3 PDF file. If you don't like the aspect ratio or size,
you can change the viewport size in the `bin/phantom-slippy-to-pdf.js` file. If you have rendering issues (missing
images or such), try increasing the delay, or rendering again, sometimes PhantomJS just fails without apparent reason.

Changelog
---------

Compatibility
-------------

It should work with all browsers, except for the overview function that does not work in IE8 and below.
